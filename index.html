    <!-- All of the Node.js APIs are available in this renderer process. -->
    We are using Node.js <script>document.write(process.versions.node)</script>,
    Chromium <script>document.write(process.versions.chrome)</script>,
    and Electron <script>document.write(process.versions.electron)</script>.
    <br>
    note that we are NOT going to use links like this!!! single page site!
    <br>
    Links to the <a href="view-project.html">Project View</a>
    <br>
    Links to the <a href="projects.html">Projects View</a> (ideas for better naming?)

    <script>
      // You can also require other files to run in this process
      require('./renderer.js')
