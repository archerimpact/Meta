      Archer’s goal is to make technology that promotes transparency and accountability on a global scale.
      To achieve our mission, we build tools and craft tech solutions with the intent of maximizing their ability to inform and protect. We create tech for anyone — whether that be a head of state or your next door neighbor.

    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="mb-5">
      <p>Archer is an international nonprofit organization founded and operated by UC Berkeley students and alumni.</p>
      <p>Our story begins in July 2016, when the UC Berkeley community was rocked by the deaths of <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2016/07/02/uc-berkeley-student-among-those-killed-in-bangladesh-terrorist-attack/"> Tarishi Jain </a> and <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2016/07/19/campus-mourns-death-junior-nick-leslie-nice-attack/"> Nick Leslie</a> from terrorist attacks at opposite ends of the world— Dhaka, Bangladesh and Nice, France. After losing friends and even witnessing the Bastille Day attack firsthand, we felt the need to empower our community by crafting innovative tech solutions to seemingly impenetrable problems, like terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>At first, we created products through a class we designed with the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology. We developed four prototypes all concerned with public data: Dashbit, OFACasaurus, Charity Cases, and Flight Track. After presenting our solutions at the Booz Allen Innovation Center and to the Department of Treasury in Washington D.C., we realized there was a huge demand for a fresh take on digital innovation.</p>
      <p>By fall 2017, we had incorporated into a nonprofit, employeed a team of 25, and partnered with experts in the industry, like C4ADS and the Human Rights Center at Boalt Law School.</p>
      <p>As we continue to grow and create, we strive to stay true to our roots of using technology as a form of empowerment.</p>
